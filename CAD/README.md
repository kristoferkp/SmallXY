# CAD files

The f3z is a Autodesk Fusion archive. I would recommend to open it in a new folder as there will be a bunch of files in there when uploaded.

The STEP files are there for compatibility. Do note, that there isn't version history included in the step file.

See the Cantilever files for the design.

## The CoreXY

The CoreXY was not and still isn't finalized. Please do not try to build one as it is incomplete. It is there to show that I actually did something and did not snooze all day.
